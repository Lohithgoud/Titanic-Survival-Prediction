# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a Machine Learning model. The dataset contains information about passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and other attributes, which are used to train a classification model.

## Objectives
- Explore the Titanic dataset to understand patterns in survival rates.
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features for better model performance.
- Train a Logistic Regression model to predict survival.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lohithgoud/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `Titanic_Survival_Prediction_By_Lohith.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Model Training & Evaluation
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets (70-30 split).
- A Logistic Regression model is trained on the data.
- Predictions are evaluated using accuracy score and classification metrics.

## Results & Future Improvements
- The model provides a baseline for Titanic survival prediction.
- Further improvements can be made by testing other machine learning models, performing hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering.
